The test distribution is selected based on two criteria:

- To show generalization from the train goals.
- To increase test accuracy each time an additional ground truth operator is correctly learned.
- To order the problems from hard (problem1) to easy (problem-n).

To adhere to such criteria, the test goals have been selected as:
